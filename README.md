A smart marriage contract on Ethereum using Truffle, a plain HTML, JS + Bootstrap 4 frontend and Web3.

## Install

Make sure `npm`, `Truffle` and `Ganache` is installed on your machine. Use `npm` to download all project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Development

First create a new file called `secrets.js` in the root of the project directory. The `mnemonic` is used by Truffle to deploy the contract.

```js
module.exports = {
  mnemonic: "put your secret seed phrase here" // <-- you need to paste your e.g. MetaMask seed here
}
```

Compile and deploy the smart contract to the local testnet using `Truffle`:

```
truffle deploy
```

Then start the web server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

The smart contract is already deployed and live on both the Ethereum mainnet and testnet:

#### Mainnet

```solidity
0x0
```

#### Testnet (Ropsten)

```solidity
0x0
```

Feel free to install MetaMask and interact with the contract (as far as you are allowed to ðŸ˜‰).
