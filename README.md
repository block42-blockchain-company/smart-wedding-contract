A smart marriage contract on Ethereum using Truffle, a plain HTML, JS + Bootstrap 4 frontend and Web3.

## Install

Make sure `npm`, `Truffle` and `Ganache` is installed on your machine. Use `npm` to download all project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Also make sure you use `Truffle` with version `v4.1.15`:

```
npm install truffle@4
```

## Development

First create a new file called `secrets.js` in the root of the project directory. The privage keys are used by Truffle to deploy the contract.

```js
module.exports = {
  privateKeysPrivateTestnet: [
    "dd4e...fa41" // private testnet private key
  ],
  privateKeysRopstenTestnet: [
    "bc35...ffd6" // ropsten testnet private key
  ],
  privateKeysMainnet: [
    "ba1a...336e" // mainnet private key
  ],
  infuraApiKey: "f5db...da74" // infura api key
}
```

Make sure there is enough ETH on the wallet to cover deployment costs. Compile and deploy the smart contract to the private testnet using `Truffle`:

```
truffle deploy
```

If you only want to deploy a specific migration (e.g. to save gas):

```
truffle deploy -f <migration number> --to <migration number>
```

Start the web server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Usage

The smart contract is already deployed and can be found at:

### Ethereum Networks

#### Ropsten (Testnet)

```solidity
0xb586324bf62224b414849b9e77d4f57ed3f10dfe
```

ðŸ‘‰ find it on [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xb586324bf62224b414849b9e77d4f57ed3f10dfe#code)

#### Mainnet (Live)

```solidity
0x6947335452cb7a452fc337c28cb0d597806c7672
```

ðŸ‘‰ find it on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6947335452cb7a452fc337c28cb0d597806c7672#code)

Feel free to install MetaMask and interact with the contract (as far as you are allowed to ðŸ˜‰).

### Assets

Assets are stored in an encrypted format on the blockchain to ensure privacy. Ethereum does not support encryption at the moment so `CryptoJS` is used to perform client side encryption/decryption. You can access the encrypted assets on the `Ropsten` testnet using the key: `block42`
